NOTE: Work-in-progress.

Implements protective barriers, craftable by way of a Protective Paling item (accessory). Barriers will stop incoming projectiles and enemy NPCs, as long as they have a charge (scales with size). Charge is reduced by damage. Craftable from Magi-Tech Scrap, which is dropped by mech bosses. Barriers may have their size/hp, regeneration rate, defense, or hardness (shrink resist) adjusted freely.

Upgrades, placeable palings (as tiles), and an API will be added eventually.
