NOTE: Work-in-progress.

Implements protective barriers, craftable by way of a 'Protective Paling' item (accessory). Craftable from Magi-Tech Scrap, dropped by mech bosses (WIP). Barriers may have their size/hp, regeneration rate, defense, or hardness (shrink resist) adjusted freely.

Upgrades, placeable palings (as tiles), and an API will be added eventually.
