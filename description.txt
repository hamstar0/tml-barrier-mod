Implements protective barriers, craftable by way of a Paling item. A Paling may be equipped as an accessory to protect your player, or placed as a tile to protect an area. Palings may be crafted with Magi-Tech scrap (found scattered around the world), and upgrades may also be added to increase size, strength, and 'hardness' of barriers.
