# Barriers

Implements protective barriers, craftable by way of a 'Protecctive Paling' item. Palings may be equipped as accessories, or placed as a tile to protect an area. Palings may be crafted and upgraded with Magi-Tech items (dropped from mech bosses, martian invasions, or crafted from end-game ingredients). Upgrades include size, strength, and hardness.
